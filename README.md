# grt-bustime

Fetch the next two Grand River Transit (GRT) bus arrival times at a stop using a Raspberry Pi and show the arrival time for the two selected bus routes on 7 segment displays.

This project is not affiliated in any way with Grand River Transit. I just like transit.

Interested in doing this yourself? Read the instructions and find a parts list in ```./docs/Instructions.md```.

## Why?

There are two busses at the nearest bus stop to my apartment which go to the University of Waterloo. I would like to know when they will arrive at my stop so I can leave early enough to catch them.

This hardware solution is a fun little project and a satifying way to check the times without having to pull out my phone and look at a transit app. It's also a fantastic way for me to try out writing code using an AI Agent (Copilot).
